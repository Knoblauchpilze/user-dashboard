# user-dashboard

The current project was created using the template over at [template-frontend](https://github.com/Knoblauchpilze/template-frontend).

This README was auto-generated and needs to be updated with an actual description of what this project does.

Also, don't forget to replace the service's name used in the [Dockerfile](build/Dockerfile).
